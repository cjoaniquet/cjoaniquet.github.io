           <p align="justify"> Songbook plays music full of improvisation and songs that are constantly worn by the love of a good melody. </p>
<p align="justify"> From a pygmy village in Cameroon to soloist in Montpellier's Opera, the French bass player Brice Soniano can bring with his playing from folk world music to baroque or jazz. He is currently based on the modern jazz and improvisation scene, mainly in Belgium and France.</p>
<p align="justify">Drummer Kasper Tom Christiansen made, over the last few years, his name in the European improvisation / advantgarde scene. Not just by being the leader of the groups Kasper Tom / Jacob Anderskov, FUSK and Kasper Tom 5, but also as a sideman in other projects with musicians like Alexander von Schlippenbach, Axel Dorner and Johannes Bauer.</p><p><a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=DWTHRG8YTZVRS"> <button class="blue">Buy CD Songbook - 10€</button></a><p><font size="2">

          <font size="2"><p>The members of In Motion are: Cesar Joaniquet from Spain, Kasper Agnas from Sweden and Timo van Ruiswijk from the Netherlands. This trio is a proof that music in Europe is more and more something that crosses borders in the most literal sense of the word. We are proud to be part of a new, young generation that plays instrumental music. This album consists of 10 songs, most are written by ourselves:<p><img src="/img/llista.jpg" alt="llista"><p>
 In Motion is an instrumental trio: saxophone, guitar and drums. This is not the most common set-up for a trio, since most trios consist of a bass instrument. This lack of thickness that the bass would provide opens up a whole new space that gives the musicians of the band a lot of room to develop the improvisations. We find it interesting to make not too much rules on how to play each tune, so each tune sounds different each time we play it.<p> Our album cover is designed by 300 children of the primary school Elisenda de Montcada located in the outskirts of Barcelona. They have made some beautiful designs. So, we have a limited amount of copies and all of them are different. For each sale of this copies we give a donation to the instruments funds of the school.<p><a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=4VC3XCSRAMRLL"> <button class="blue">Buy CD In Motion - 10€</button></a><p><font size="2">
