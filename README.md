## Introduction
This is the website of Cesar Joaniquet, [cesarjoaniquet.com](http://cesarjoaniquet.com).

## Instructions for testing locally
To test the website locally on macOS execute the `localserver.command` file (by double-clicking), which will spin up a local server on the address [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000) for testing purposes.
First time you run the server, you must press "allow" when the dialogue box appears and asks for Python permissions.
